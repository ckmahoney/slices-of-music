# Shapes of Sound 

Between 2021 and 2022, I spent a lot of time exploring new methods of writing music. The methods in include concepts of algebra, trigonometry, and programmer's combinatorics. The work is then applied to SuperColliderto render code to audio file. 

A highly interesting aspect of these methods is scalability: 
Traditional music composition is not at all scalable in that you must explicitly write every note for every part. 
Here I am able to genrealize the notes that go into a set of parts. As a result, each of the source files represents a space of recordings. What we have here is simply one permutation of thousands of possible alternatives. In other words, _mass produce reliably good music_. 

The title of each recording comes directly from the filename from which it was generated. For a few of the better templates, I made extra renditions. When a title ends with `-a`, `-b`, or `-c`, that means it is another permutation of that template. 

You will see the word "study" appear often in the titles. I consider most of these to be etudes. My goals over the next year is to take these discoveries and turn them into proper music.
